				<h3><b><u>Transportation Options</u></b></h3>	
			<p>Anuradhapura is served by railway and highways. The <b>Northern railway line</b> connects Anuradhapura with <b>Colombo</b>, <b>Jaffna</b>, and <b>Kankesanthurai</b>.<b> Anuradhapura railway station</b> is the city's rail gateway, with major services, such as the <b>Yal Devi</b>, stopping there.</p>

				<h3><b><u>Healthcare Facilities</u></b></h3>
				<p>Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, the only tertiary care hospital in the North Central region and one of the largest in Sri Lanka, offers healthcare services to a population of over two million within the district and in neighbouring districts. With a daily average of over 1,000 out patients and an occupancy rate of 115% the hospital was congested and therefore hindered the provision of appropriate and timely medical services.</p>
				<p>The new facility and equipment were provided at the request of the Government of Sri Lanka to facilitate the transformation of the Anuradhapura hospital from a general hospital to a teaching hospital. The hospital with its new facility stands as a beacon of hope to thousands of people across the district and in neighbouring districts, providing quality healthcare services and minimizing difficulties faced by patients who will otherwise have to travel long distances to obtain such services.</p>
