			<h1><u>Culture</u></h1>
		<p>Culture in the Anuradhapura Kingdom was largely based on Buddhism with the slaughter of animals for food considered low and unclean. As a result, animal husbandry, except for the rearing of <b>buffalo</b> and cattle, was uncommon. Elephants and horses were prestige symbols, and could only be afforded by the nobility. The skills needed to train and care for these animals were highly regarded .Cattle and buffalo were used for ploughing and preparing<b> paddy fields</b>. Dairy products formed an important part of people's diets while <b>Pali</b> and <b>Sinhala literature</b> often refer to five products obtained from the cow: <b>milk, curd, buttermilk, ghee</b> and<b> butter</b>. Bullocks and <b>bullock carts</b> were also used for transport.</p>
		<p>Metalwork was an important and well-developed craft, and metal tools such as axes, <b>mammoties</b> and hoes were widely used. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military.A good indication of the development of metalwork of this period is the <b>Lovamahapaya</b>, which had been roofed entirely with copper.</p>
		<p>Villages were usually concentrated around irrigation reservoirs to enable easy access to water for agriculture. Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment, between the water and the paddy fields below. This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production.A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy fields, a reservoir, a grazing ground, <b>shift crop</b> reserves and a village forest. In areas of high rainfall, a <b>perennial watercourse</b> often took the place of the reservoir. Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs.Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.</p>

		<h3><b><u>Religion</u></b></h3>
		<p>After the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa, it spread throughout the country under his patronage.After this, the rulers were expected to be the protectors of Buddhism in the country and it became a legitimizing factor of royal authority.Three fraternities of Buddhism had come into existence by the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom; Mahavihara, Abhayagiri and Jetavana.<b> Mahavihara</b> was established immediately after the introduction of Buddhism to the country. Representing the Theravada teachings, it remained strictly conventional throughout the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The Abhayagiri fraternity, established after <b>Abhayagiriya</b> was built, represented several schools of Buddhist thought. It did not restrict itself to Theravada and accepted Mahayana and Tantric ideas as well. Little evidence exists on the Jetavana fraternity which was established after the <b>Jetavanaramaya </b>was built, later than the other two. However, it too was receptive to new and more liberal views regarding Buddhism.</p>
		<p>Rulers sponsored <b>Theravada</b> and often took steps to stop the spreading of <b>Mahayana</b> beliefs. Rulers such as Aggabodhi I, Kashyapa V (914–923) and Mahinda IV (956–972) promulgated disciplinary rules for the proper conduct of the Sangha. Voharika Tissa and <b>Gothabhaya</b> (249–262) expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views.A change in this occurred when Mahasena embraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions. However, he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him.As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined, Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again began to spread, however, Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine.</p>

		<p>Followers of <b>Hinduism</b> were also present to some extent during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. There were a number of them in Rajarata during Elara's reign. Mahasen destroyed several Hindu temples during his reign in the 2nd century. Particularly Indian merchant communities living near ports such as Mahatittha and Gokanna were followers of Hinduism and Hindu temples were constructed in these areas. By the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, large Hindu temples such as the<b> Konesvaram temple</b> had been constructed.Historical sources indicate that there were also <b>Jains</b> in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba.</p>

						<h3><b><u>Literature</u></b></h3>
						<p class="para"><p>From the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD, inscriptions are recorded in the <b>Brāhmī script</b>. This gradually developed into the modern <b>sinhala script</b>, but this was not complete by the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The first reference in historical sources to any written work is about 80 BC, but both Sinhala and Pali literature existed even two centuries before this, if not earlier.The oldest Sinhala literature is found at <b>Sigiriya</b>.Poems written from the 6th century to the end of the Anuradhaura kingdom are found among the graffiti on the mirror wall at Sigiriya. Most of these verses are describing or even addressed to the female figures depicted in the frescoes of Sigiriya.The majority of these poems have been written between the 8th and 10th centuries.</p>
						<p>Only three Sinhala books survive from the Anuradhapura period. One of them, Siyabaslakara, was written in the 9th or 10th century on the art of poetry and is based on the <b>Sanskrit</b> Kavyadarsha. Dampiya Atuva Gatapadaya is another, and is a glossary for the <b>Pali</b> Dhammapadatthakatha, providing Sinhala words and synonyms for Pali words. The third book is Mula Sikha Ha Sikhavalanda, a set of disciplinary rules for Buddhist monks. Both these have been written during the last two centuries of the Anuradhapura period.During the reign of Valagamba, the Pali <b>Tripitaka </b>was written in palm leaves.Several commentaries on Buddhism, known as Atthakatha have also been written during the reign of Mahanama (406–428). Pali chronicles such as <b>Dipavamsa</b> and <b>Mahavamsa</b> have been written during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and are still useful as resources for studying the history of the country.</p></p>

						<h3><b><u>Art</u></b></h3>
						<p>The Sigiriya Frescoes found at<b> Sigiriya, Sri Lanka</b> were painted during the reign of<b> King Kashyapa I </b>(ruled 477 — 495 AD). Depicting female figures carrying flowers, they are the oldest surviving paintings of the Anuradhapura period.Various theories exist as to who are shown in these paintings. Some suggest that they are <b>apsaras</b> (celestial nymphs),[113] others suggest that they are the ladies of the king's court or even a representation of lightning and rain clouds. Although they bear some similarity to the paintings of <b>Ajanta</b> in India, there are significant differences in style and composition suggesting that these are examples of a distinctive Sri Lankan school of art.</p>
						<p>Paintings from a cave at<b> Hindagala</b> date back to the late Anuradhapura period, and may even belong to the same period as the Sigiriya paintings. The paintings of Sigiriya and Hindagala are the only surviving specimens of art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, remnants of paintings indicate that walls and ceilings of some buildings and the inside walls of stupas and vahalkadas were also painted.Saddhatissa had employed painters to decorate the Ruwanweli Seya when his brother Dutthagamani wanted to see it on his death bed.</p>
						<p>Statue making, most noticeably <b>statues of the Buddha</b>, was an art perfected by the Sri Lankan sculptors during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The earliest Buddha statues belonging to the Anuradhapura period date back to the 1st century AD. Standard postures such as Abhaya Mudra, Dhyana Mudra, Vitarka Mudra and Kataka Mudra were used when making these statues. The <b>Samadhi</b> statue in Anuradhapura, considered one of the finest examples of ancient Sri Lankan art,shows the Buddha in a seated position in deep meditation, and is sculpted from <b>dolomite </b>marble and is datable to the 4th century. The <b>Toluvila</b> statue is similar to this, and dates to the later stages of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Notable standing Buddha statues dating from the Anuradhapura period include the ones at <b>Avukana, Maligavila</b> and <b>Buduruvagala</b>. The Buduruvagala statue is the tallest in the country, standing at 50 feet (15 m). All these statues are carved out of rock.</p>
						<p>The carvings at <b>Isurumuniya</b> are some of the best examples of the <b>stone carving</b> art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Skill in arts was a respected and valued trait during this period and artists were well rewarded by the rulers. The Mahavamsa records that <b>Jetthatissa II</b> (328–337) was himself skilled in stone and <b>ivory carving</b>.</p>
