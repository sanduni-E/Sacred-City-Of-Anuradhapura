		<h1><u>History</u></h1>
			<p>
				The <b>Anuradhapura Kingdom</b> (Sinhala: අනුරාධපුර රාජධානිය, translit: Anurādhapura Rājadhāniya, Tamil: அனுராதபுர இராச்சியம்), named for its capital city, was the first established kingdom in ancient Sri Lanka and Sinhalese people. Founded by King <b>Pandukabhaya</b> in 377 BC, the kingdom's authority extended throughout the country, although several independent areas emerged from time to time, which grew more numerous towards the end of the kingdom. Nonetheless, the king of Anuradhapura was seen as the supreme ruler of the country throughout the Anuradhapura period. Buddhism played a strong role in the Anuradhapura period, influencing its culture, laws, and methods of governance.[N 2] Society and culture were revolutionized when the faith was introduced during the reign of King <b>Devanampiya Tissa</b>; this cultural change was further strengthened by the arrival of the <b>Tooth Relic of the Buddha</b> in Sri Lanka and the patronage extended by her rulers.

						<p>Invasions from South India were a constant threat throughout the Anuradhapura period. Rulers such as <b>Dutugemunu, Valagamba,</b> and <b>Dhatusena</b> are noted for defeating the South Indians and regaining control of the kingdom. Other rulers who are notable for military achievements include <b>Gajabahu I</b>, who launched an invasion against the invaders, and Sena II, who sent his armies to assist a Pandyan prince.</p>
						<p>Because the kingdom was largely based on agriculture, the construction of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably <b>Vasabha</b> and<b> Mahasena</b>, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are an indication of the advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at<b> Sigiriya</b>; the <b>Ruwanwelisaya</b>, <b>Jetavana stupas</b>, and other large stupas; large buildings like the <b>Lovamahapaya</b>; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.</p>

						<h3><b><u>Arrival of Buddhism</u></b></h3>
						<p>One of the most notable events during the Anuradhapura Kingdom was the introduction of Buddhism to the country. A strong alliance existed between <b>Devanampiya Tissa</b> (250–210 BC) and <b>Ashoka</b> of India,[25] who sent <b>Arahat Mahinda</b>, four monks, and a novice being sent to Sri Lanka.[26] They encountered Devanampiya Tissa at <b>Mihintale</b>. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism and the order of monks was established in the country.[27] Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to firmly establish Buddhism in the country.</p>
						<p>Soon afterwards, the <b>bhikkhuni Sanghamitta</b> arrived from India in order to establish the Bhikkhuni sasana (order of nuns) in the country.[29] She brought along with her a sapling from the<b> Sri Maha Bodhi</b>, the tree under which the Buddha attained <b>enlightenment</b>, which was then planted in Anuradhapura.[30] Devanampiya Tissa bestowed on his kingdom the newly planted <b>Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi</b>.[31] Thus this is the establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.</p>

							<h3><b><u>Invasions</u></b></h3>
							<p>Several invasions have been made against the Anuradhapura Kingdom, all of which were launched from <b>South India</b>. The first invasion recorded in the history of the country is during the reign of <b>Suratissa</b> (247–237 BC), where he was overthrown by two horse dealers from South India named Sena and Guththika. After ruling the country for 22 years, they were defeated by <b>Asela</b> (215–205 BC), who was in turn overthrown by another invasion led by a Chola prince named <b>Ellalan</b> (205–161 BC).[36] Elara ruled for 44 years before being defeated by Dutthagamani (Duttugamunu) [37] However, the Mahavamsa records that these foreign kings ruled the country fairly and lawfully.</p>
							<p>The country was invaded again in 103 BC by five <b>Dravidian chiefs, Pulahatta, Bahiya, Panya Mara, Pilaya Mara</b> and <b>Dathika</b>, who ruled until 89 BC when they were defeated by <b>Valagamba</b>. Another invasion occurred in 433, and the country fell under the control of six rulers from South India. These were <b>Pandu, Parinda, Khudda Parinda, Tiritara, Dathiya</b> and <b>Pithiya</b>, who were defeated by <b>Dhathusena</b> who regained power in 459.[38] More invasions and raids from South India occurred during the reigns of Sena I (833–853)[39] and Udaya III (935–938).[40] The final invasion during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, which ended the kingdom and left the country under the rule of the Cholas, took place during the reign of Mahinda V.</p>
							<p>However, none of these invaders could extend their rule to <b>Ruhuna</b>, the southern part of the country, and Sri Lankan rulers and their heirs always organized their armies from this area and managed to regain their throne. Throughout the history of Sri Lanka, Ruhuna served as a base for resistance movements.</p>
							<h3><b><u>End of the kingdom</u></b></h3>
							<p>In 993, the Chola Emperor <b>Rajaraja</b> I invaded Sri Lanka, forcing the then Sri Lankan ruler Mahinda V to flee to the southern part of the country.[41] The Mahavamsa describes the rule of Mahinda V as weak, and the country was suffering from poverty by this time. It further mentions that his army rose against him due to lack of wages.[20] Taking advantage of this situation, <b>Rajendra</b> I son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura.[41] They moved the capital to <b>Polonnaruwa</b> and subsequent Sri Lankan rulers who came into power after the Chola reign continued to use Polonnaruwa as the capital, thus ending the Anuradhapura Kingdom.</p>
